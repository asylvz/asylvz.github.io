<h3>About</h3>


<p>I am a computer scientist, developing algorithms for bioinformatics and computational genomics. Currently, I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher with Tobias Marschall in <a href="https://marschall-lab.github.io/">Marschall Lab</a>, Heinrich Heine University, <a href="https://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/patienten-besucher/klinikeninstitutezentren/institut-fuer-medizinische-biometrie-und-bioinformatik/team">Institute for Medical Biometry and Bioinformatics</a> at the Medical Department (UKD). 

<p>I'm mostly interested in using high-throughput sequencing technologies for:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.0em"><em>
<li>Structural variation discovery and genotyping</li>
<li>Pangenomes</li>
<li>Ancient DNA</li>
<li>Microbiome</li> </em>
</ul>


<p>I received my PhD from Computer Engineering Department of Bilkent University in 2018. I worked with Can Alkan in <a href="http://alkanlab.org/"> Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Group</a>. Then I worked with Mehmet Somel from METU <a href="http://compevo.bio.metu.edu.tr/">CompEvo Lab</a> on structural variation genoytping in ancient genomes. I also worked in <a href="https://merenlab.org/">Meren Lab</a> at UChicago Medicine on microbiome.
