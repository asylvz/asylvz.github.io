<h3>About</h3>


<p>I'm a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://marschall-lab.github.io/">Marschall Lab</a>, Heinrich Heine University, <a href="https://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/patienten-besucher/klinikeninstitutezentren/institut-fuer-medizinische-biometrie-und-bioinformatik/team">Institute for Medical Biometry and Bioinformatics</a>. 

<p>My primary research interests lie in the development of algorithms for bioinformatics and computational genomics, particularly in the areas of</p>

<li>Structural variation discovery and genotyping</li>
<li>Pangenomes</li>
<li>Ancient DNA</li> </em>
</ul>

<p>I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Engineering at Bilkent University in 2018, where I worked under the supervision of Can Alkan in the <a href="http://alkanlab.org/"> Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Group</a>. Following this, I worked with Mehmet Somel at the METU <a href="http://compevo.bio.metu.edu.tr/">CompEvo Lab</a> Lab on structural variant genotyping in ancient genomes. I also gained experience in microbiome research in <a href="https://merenlab.org/">Meren Lab</a> at UChicago Medicine.</p>
